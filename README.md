**Emotion Detection from Text using NLP**
A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that leverages BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to identify emotions from text with high accuracy. The model classifies text into emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and more. It uses pre-trained BERT embeddings for deep contextual understanding and fine-tunes them on an emotion-labeled dataset.

Features:

Accurate emotion classification using transformer-based architecture.

Handles nuanced and context-rich sentences.

Preprocessing pipeline for tokenization, padding, and attention masks.

Supports real-time emotion prediction for custom input.

Easy to integrate into chatbots, sentiment monitoring, and analytics tools.

Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, BERT, NLP.

Applications:

Customer feedback analysis

Social media sentiment tracking

Mental health monitoring tools

AI chatbots with emotional intelligence
